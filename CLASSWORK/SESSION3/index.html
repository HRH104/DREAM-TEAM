    <h2 style="text-align: center;color:purple">Covid pandemic: Biden eyes 4 July as ‘Independence Day’ from virus</h2>
    <p> <b>President Joe Biden</b> has said he is hopeful that America can <b><i>"mark independence"</i></b> from Covid-19 on 4 July if people get vaccinated.
        In his first primetime address as president, Mr Biden said he would order states to make all adults eligible for vaccinations by 1 May.
        Current measures prioritise people by age or health condition.
        Mr Biden was speaking exactly a year to the day after the outbreak was classified a global pandemic.
